# React.dc
A Discord BOT designed to quickly add regional_indicator reactions (and a few backups/extras) to messages

## Commands:

### React:
> ^react YOUR_MESSAGE_HERE

The '^react' command is literally the only command there is.

### Usage:
Step 1: Click 'Reply' on the message that the reaction(s) will be added to

Step 2: Type '^react' followed by your message

REMINDER: There are only so many regional_indicators. There are a few backup options in the pot just in case a letter is used twice/thrice, but that's not a common option for most letters so just be careful <3

Step 3: Just send the message when it's ready to go!



p.s. this has literally nothing to do with react.js it's just the first thing i thought of when i needed a name for something that had to do with reactions and discord. /shrug
